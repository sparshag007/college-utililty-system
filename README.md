MOTIVATION BEHIND THE PROJECT:

Students of any institution are so much involved in their daily life works, assignments and projects that they are not able to manage their time properly.
So in order to reduce the stress of time management and providing the students with the basic needs required in a hostel we have designed a VIT Utility System for our institution.
The System provides the students present within the campus of VIT to access the website which contains various modules including library management system which can help a student to access the library from his own laptop and search for books, paying fine and updating their details regarding the books they have issued.
The website also includes a food ordering module which is being provided so that the students do not need to travel for food. 
It also includes the taxi booking system along with the proctor approval form option available in the website as they face various problems at the time of travelling to airport and railway stations at the time of leaving due to non-availability of taxi at a reasonable cost during semester break.
The last module of the website is related to the events being organized in our campus so that students are always aware of the future events along with a reminder option if they are going to register under an event.
With the help of the system the student is able to access various modules required for him / her in their daily life and at some particular instant so that they donâ€™t miss anything important due to their busy schedule. 

PROPOSED SYSTEM:

Our website consists of four modules regarding library, food, taxi and event registration system. The students can access this website and choose the system according to the requirements through their registration number and password.
It will help the students to get things at a fair price and even to save their time.
